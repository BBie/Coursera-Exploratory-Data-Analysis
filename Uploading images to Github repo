## Main problem: how to upload an image file into my repo in Git?

## Main problem: Uploading to GitHub with Git

# Solution:
# Create a new repo on Github "myTestRepo"
# Create a new folder on your computer called "myTestRepo", in the empty folder, create a txt file called "myfile"
# Open "myfile.txt", and wtite anything you want, even just some random words.
# Save and close the txt file

# Open Git Bash, type the following:
$ cd Documents/GitHub/myTestRepo
# do a "git init" to see the documents
$ git init
# Then see the following: 
### Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Bijie/Documents/GitHub/myTestRepo/.git/
# The repo is not connected to Github. In order to create snapshots, type: 
$ git add .
# Do a "git commit":
$ git commit -m "add the first file"
# Then see the following: 
### [master (root-commit) e5b3fa7] add the first file
### 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
### create mode 100644 myfile.txt
# We have a snapshot in the local repo, but it's all saved on the drive, nothing is on Github right now.

# To make it on Github, return to the "Quick setup" webpage when we created the new repo on Github
# Copy the first line of the box "Push an existing repository from the command line"
# Paste to Git, make a remote and link to the repository
# copy the second line of the box "Push an existing repository from the command line"
# Paste to Git, then it will ask you the credentials of Github
$ git push -u origin master
