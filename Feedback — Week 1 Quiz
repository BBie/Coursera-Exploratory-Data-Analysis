Question 3  Which of the following is true about the base plotting system?

Plots are created and annotated with separate functions	                Correct	1.00	 ## Functions like 'plot' or 'hist' typically create the plot on the graphics device and functions like 'lines', 'text', or 'points' will annotate or add data to the plot.
Margins and spacings are adjusted automatically depending on the type of plot and the data			
Plots are typically created with a single function call			
The system is most useful for conditioning plots
